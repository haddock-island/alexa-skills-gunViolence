				"A third of the bees die during the winter months. That's nearly double the typical rate of 15% to 20% in a healthy colony.",
				"In April 2015, researchers reported that beekeepers lost 42.1% of their colonies in the prior 12 months. That's 8% worse than in 2014. It's also the first time in history that they lost more bees during the summer than in the winter.",
		    		"If colony collapse disorder continues at the current rate, managed honey bees will disappear by 2035.",
				"The colony collapse disorder began in the 1980s. That's when two bloodsucking parasitic mites were accidentally introduced into the United States.",
				"Bee pollination is worth $15 billion to the U.S. farming industry.",
				"Disruption of the honey bee supply raised prices for domestically grown nuts, fruits, and vegetables. In California, it tripled pollination fees.",
				"Bees pollinate clover, hay, and other forage crops. As they die off, it raises the cost of feedstock. That will eventually increase beef and milk prices at the grocery store.",
				"The Environmental Protection Agency announced a moratorium on approving new use of neonicotinoid pesticides. It proposes to prohibit these pesticides when crops are in bloom and bees are present. It will also re-evaluate the use of these pesticides. It plans to finalize regulations in 2016. These pesticides have already been outlawed by the European Union.",
				"Colony Collapse Disorder was recognized as a serious threat in 2006. Scientists have long suspected some combination of viruses, pesticides, and fungicides made the bees vulnerable to the mites.",
				"During Bee Colony Collapse, the bees don't die in their hives. Instead, they fly off to die alone.",
				"Beekeepers are fighting back by breeding more bees. They divide the hives in the spring and summer, forcing the bees to create more queens.",
				"During the winter of 2006-2007, some beekeepers in the United States began to report unusually high losses of 30-90 percent of their hives. The reason is unknown.",
				"There are several theories about the cause of Colony Collapse Disorder, but the researchers who are leading the effort to find out why are focused on a small set of factors. One factor is increased losses due to the invasive varroa mite (a pest of honey bees).",
				"There are several theories about the cause of Colony Collapse Disorder, but the researchers who are leading the effort to find out why are focused on a small set of factors. One factor is new or emerging diseases such as Israeli Acute Paralysis virus and the gut parasite Nosema.",
				"There are several theories about the cause of Colony Collapse Disorder, but one factor researchers are considering is pesticide poisoning.",
				"There are several theories about the cause of Colony Collapse Disorder, but one factor researchers are considering is the stress bees experience due to transportation across the country for pollination services.",
				"A factor that may be contributing to Colony Collapse Disorder is changes to the habitat where bees forage.",
				"A factor that may be contributing to Colony Collapse Disorder is inadequate forage for the bees, or general poor nutrition.",
				"A factor that may be contributing to Colony Collapse Disorder is potential immune-suppressing stress on bees.",
				"Losses of managed honey bee colonies were 23.1 percent for the 2014-2015 winter. Unfortunately, summer losses exceeded winter numbers for the first time, making annual losses for the year 42.1 percent",
				"Beekeepers are losing colonies both in the winter and throughout the summer, sometimes at significant levels.",
				"About two-thirds of the beekeepers responding to a 2015 survey reported losses greater than 18.7 percent, a number viewed as economically acceptable. This underlines the seriousness of the health problems stressing bees in this country.",

				"In the United States, beekeepers who prepared their colonies for winter did not report losing more or less colonies than beekeepers who did not prepare their colonies for winter.",
				"In the United States, beekeepers who kept their bees in colonies with brood comb of less than 2 years old reported significantly higher overwintering colony deaths than beekeepers who used brood comb older than 2 years.",
